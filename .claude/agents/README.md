## 🎯 Quick Start

### How Agents Work

1. **Automatic Invocation** - Claude Code automatically selects agents based on your message
2. **Explicit Invocation** - You can request specific agents: "Use the frontend-ux-specialist to design this screen"
3. **Complementary** - Multiple agents can work together (e.g., UX specialist designs, implementation coach codes)

### ⚠️ Anti-Cyclic Dependency Rule (CRITICAL)

**To prevent infinite loops, this hierarchy must be strictly enforced:**

```
Slash Commands (high-level orchestration)
    ↓ can call
Agents (task execution)
    ↓ can call
Other Agents (delegation)
    ↓ NEVER call
Slash Commands ❌ (would create cycle)
```

**Rules:**
- ✅ **Commands CAN call agents** - Example: `/finish-session` calls `tech-writer`
- ✅ **Agents CAN call other agents** - Example: `backend-code-reviewer` calls `tech-writer`
- ❌ **Agents MUST NEVER call commands** - Would create infinite loops

**Why this matters:**
- Commands are "entry points" (user-initiated workflows)
- Agents are "workers" (execute specific tasks)
- Workers can delegate to other workers, but never back to entry points
- Violating this rule causes cyclic dependencies and infinite loops

**Example Safe Delegation:**
```
/finish-session (command)
  → calls tech-writer (agent)
    → calls automation-sentinel (agent)  ✅ SAFE
    → NEVER calls /finish-session again  ❌ CYCLIC
```

### First Time Setup

Agents are already configured in `.claude/agents/`. No additional setup needed!

```bash
# Verify agents are available
ls .claude/agents/

# Should see (alphabetically):
# - automation-sentinel.md
# - backend-code-reviewer.md
# - cross-project-architect.md
# - flutter-implementation-coach.md
# - frontend-ux-specialist.md
# - learning-tutor.md
# - README.md
# - session-optimizer.md
# - tech-writer.md
```

## 🚀 Agent Usage Guide

### 1. Automation Sentinel (Meta-Agent)

**🔍 Use when:**
- Checking automation ecosystem health
- Finding redundant agents or commands
- Generating automation usage reports
- Detecting obsolete automations
- Getting optimization recommendations

**Example prompts:**
- "Check automation health"
- "Generate automation ecosystem report"
- "Are my agents redundant?"
- "Which automations are most valuable?"
- "Find unused commands"

**What you get:**
- Comprehensive health report (schema validation, dependency checks)
- Usage analytics dashboard (most/least used automations)
- Redundancy detection (overlapping responsibilities)
- Obsolescence warnings (unused automations)
- Optimization recommendations (consolidation, new automation ideas)

**Strengths:**
- Meta-level oversight (monitors all other agents)
- Data-driven recommendations
- Self-monitoring (validates its own schema)
- Non-destructive (recommends, never auto-deletes)

---

### 2. Pulse (Metrics Collection)

**⚡ Use when:**
- Automatically triggered before automation-sentinel (no manual invocation needed)
- Manually updating automation metrics
- Resetting metrics baseline

**Example prompts:**
- "Update automation metrics"
- "Collect usage data"
- "Reset metrics baseline"

**What you get:**
- Updated `.claude/metrics/usage-stats.toml` (TOML format, git-tracked)
- Delta report showing new activity since last run
- Consolidated lifetime totals (not just incremental changes)
- Fast execution (~30 seconds, ~500-1000 tokens using Haiku)

**Strengths:**
- Uses Haiku model (10x cheaper than Sonnet)
- Delta mode (50-80% token savings vs full history scans)
- Git-aware checkpoints (uses commit SHA for synchronization)
- Feeds data to automation-sentinel (separation of concerns)

**Integration with automation-sentinel:**
```
/create-pr workflow:
  1. pulse --mode=delta (collect metrics, update TOML)
  2. automation-sentinel --mode=delta (read TOML, analyze)

Result: 75% token reduction vs previous full-scan approach

## 🎭 Agent Combinations (Workflows)

### Workflow 1: Feature Development (Frontend + Backend)

**Goal:** Implement complete feature end-to-end

**Steps:**
1. **Session Optimizer** - Plan token-efficient session
2. **Frontend UX Specialist** - Design UI/screens
3. **Flutter Implementation Coach** - Implement frontend
4. **Backend Code Reviewer** - Review backend API

**Example:**
```
"Plan an efficient session to implement wine review submission"
→ Session Optimizer provides plan

"Design the review submission screen"
→ Frontend UX Specialist designs UI

"Implement the review submission flow with Riverpod"
→ Flutter Implementation Coach codes feature

"Review the ReviewController and ReviewService"
→ Backend Code Reviewer analyzes quality

"/finish-session review submission feature complete"
→ Session Optimizer guides completion
```

---

### Workflow 2: Learning + Practice

**Goal:** Learn new concept, practice, apply to project

**Steps:**
1. **Learning Tutor** - Teach concept with exercises
2. **Flutter Implementation Coach** - Apply to real feature
3. **Frontend UX Specialist** - Refine UI implementation

**Example:**
```
"Teach me Riverpod StateNotifier pattern"
→ Learning Tutor provides lesson + exercises

"Now implement review list using StateNotifier"
→ Flutter Implementation Coach guides implementation

"Improve the review list UI with better loading states"
→ Frontend UX Specialist enhances UX
```

---

### Workflow 3: New Project Setup

"Review the initial backend structure I copied"
→ Backend Code Reviewer validates setup

"Design the product catalog screen"
→ Frontend UX Specialist creates UI
```

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Let Agents Choose Automatically

**✅ Good:**
```
"I need to design the login screen with Google Sign-In"
```
Claude Code sees "design" + "screen" → invokes frontend-ux-specialist automatically

**❌ Less Efficient:**
```
"Use the frontend-ux-specialist agent to design the login screen"
```
Explicit invocation works but wastes tokens

**When to be explicit:**
- Agent selection is ambiguous
- You want specific agent's approach
- Testing agent behavior

---

### 2. Use Session Optimizer at Session Start

**Start every session:**
```
@ROADMAP.md

Quick session start via session-optimizer.

Goal: [specific goal]
Scope: [in/out]
```

**Benefits:**
- Minimal token load (ROADMAP.md only)
- Clear plan prevents waste
- Token budget awareness

---

### 3. Combine Agents for Complex Tasks

**Example: New feature from design to tests**
```
Step 1: "Design review detail screen" → frontend-ux-specialist
Step 2: "Implement screen with Riverpod" → flutter-implementation-coach
Step 3: "Review backend API" → backend-code-reviewer
Step 4: "Teach me testing patterns" → learning-tutor
```

---

### 4. Use Learning Tutor Before Implementation

**When stuck on concept:**
```
1. "Teach me AsyncValue in Riverpod" → learning-tutor
2. Do exercises offline
3. "Now implement review list with AsyncValue" → flutter-implementation-coach
```

**Benefits:**
- Understand before implementing
- Fewer mistakes
- More efficient implementation

---

### 5. Review Backend Code Proactively

**After implementing testable class:**
```
"Just finished ReviewService implementation"
→ backend-code-reviewer automatically invoked

OR

"/finish-session review service complete"
→ Runs tests, then suggests code review
```

## 🛠️ Agent Creation Standards

**CRITICAL RULE: Front Matter Required for All Agents** *(Added 2025-10-31)*

When creating new custom agents in `.claude/agents/`, **always include YAML front matter** for Claude Code's agent discovery system:

### Required Front Matter Fields

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: Use this agent when [trigger conditions]. Examples - User: "[example 1]" → Use this agent. User: "[example 2]" → Use this agent.
model: sonnet|haiku|opus
color: purple|blue|cyan|yellow|etc
---
```

### Pre-Commit Quality Checklist

- [ ] Front matter exists with all required fields (`name`, `description`, `model`, `color`)
- [ ] Description includes clear trigger conditions with examples
- [ ] Agent body has required sections:
  - [ ] Purpose statement
  - [ ] Core Responsibilities
  - [ ] When to Trigger (Automatic + Manual)
  - [ ] Integration with other agents (if applicable)
  - [ ] Usage examples (minimum 2)
- [ ] Markdown syntax is valid (no broken links, proper headers)
- [ ] Code blocks have language specifiers
- [ ] Agent follows project conventions (CLAUDE.md, CODING_STYLE_GENERAL.md + stack-specific files)

### Why This Matters

- **Without front matter:** Agents can't be auto-triggered by Claude Code
- **Missing sections:** Reduces agent effectiveness and discoverability
- **Consistent structure:** Ensures maintainability across agent suite

### Validation

Before committing new agents, run `automation-sentinel` to validate schema and check for issues.
