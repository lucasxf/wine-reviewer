## üéØ Quick Start

### How Agents Work

1. **Automatic Invocation** - Claude Code automatically selects agents based on your message
2. **Explicit Invocation** - You can request specific agents: "Use the frontend-ux-specialist to design this screen"
3. **Complementary** - Multiple agents can work together (e.g., UX specialist designs, implementation coach codes)

### First Time Setup

Agents are already configured in `.claude/agents/`. No additional setup needed!

```bash
# Verify agents are available
ls .claude/agents/

# Should see:
# - backend-code-reviewer.md
# - frontend-ux-specialist.md
# - flutter-implementation-coach.md
# - learning-tutor.md
# - session-optimizer.md
# - cross-project-architect.md
```

## üé≠ Agent Combinations (Workflows)

### Workflow 1: Feature Development (Frontend + Backend)

**Goal:** Implement complete feature end-to-end

**Steps:**
1. **Session Optimizer** - Plan token-efficient session
2. **Frontend UX Specialist** - Design UI/screens
3. **Flutter Implementation Coach** - Implement frontend
4. **Backend Code Reviewer** - Review backend API
5. **Session Optimizer** - Finish session efficiently

**Example:**
```
"Plan an efficient session to implement wine review submission"
‚Üí Session Optimizer provides plan

"Design the review submission screen"
‚Üí Frontend UX Specialist designs UI

"Implement the review submission flow with Riverpod"
‚Üí Flutter Implementation Coach codes feature

"Review the ReviewController and ReviewService"
‚Üí Backend Code Reviewer analyzes quality

"/finish-session review submission feature complete"
‚Üí Session Optimizer guides completion
```

---

### Workflow 2: Learning + Practice

**Goal:** Learn new concept, practice, apply to project

**Steps:**
1. **Learning Tutor** - Teach concept with exercises
2. **Flutter Implementation Coach** - Apply to real feature
3. **Frontend UX Specialist** - Refine UI implementation

**Example:**
```
"Teach me Riverpod StateNotifier pattern"
‚Üí Learning Tutor provides lesson + exercises

"Now implement review list using StateNotifier"
‚Üí Flutter Implementation Coach guides implementation

"Improve the review list UI with better loading states"
‚Üí Frontend UX Specialist enhances UX
```

---

### Workflow 3: New Project Setup

**Goal:** Start new project with proven patterns

**Steps:**
1. **Cross-Project Architect** - Extract patterns, create templates
2. **Session Optimizer** - Plan efficient initialization
3. **Backend Code Reviewer** - Review initial setup
4. **Frontend UX Specialist** - Design initial screens

**Example:**
```
"Extract reusable patterns from Wine Reviewer for new e-commerce project"
‚Üí Cross-Project Architect analyzes and extracts

"Plan efficient session to initialize new project"
‚Üí Session Optimizer provides setup plan

"Review the initial backend structure I copied"
‚Üí Backend Code Reviewer validates setup

"Design the product catalog screen"
‚Üí Frontend UX Specialist creates UI
```

---

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Let Agents Choose Automatically

**‚úÖ Good:**
```
"I need to design the login screen with Google Sign-In"
```
Claude Code sees "design" + "screen" ‚Üí invokes frontend-ux-specialist automatically

**‚ùå Less Efficient:**
```
"Use the frontend-ux-specialist agent to design the login screen"
```
Explicit invocation works but wastes tokens

**When to be explicit:**
- Agent selection is ambiguous
- You want specific agent's approach
- Testing agent behavior

---

### 2. Use Session Optimizer at Session Start

**Start every session:**
```
@ROADMAP.md

Quick session start via session-optimizer.

Goal: [specific goal]
Scope: [in/out]
```

**Benefits:**
- Minimal token load (ROADMAP.md only)
- Clear plan prevents waste
- Token budget awareness

---

### 3. Combine Agents for Complex Tasks

**Example: New feature from design to tests**
```
Step 1: "Design review detail screen" ‚Üí frontend-ux-specialist
Step 2: "Implement screen with Riverpod" ‚Üí flutter-implementation-coach
Step 3: "Review backend API" ‚Üí backend-code-reviewer
Step 4: "Teach me testing patterns" ‚Üí learning-tutor
```

---

### 4. Use Learning Tutor Before Implementation

**When stuck on concept:**
```
1. "Teach me AsyncValue in Riverpod" ‚Üí learning-tutor
2. Do exercises offline
3. "Now implement review list with AsyncValue" ‚Üí flutter-implementation-coach
```

**Benefits:**
- Understand before implementing
- Fewer mistakes
- More efficient implementation

---

### 5. Review Backend Code Proactively

**After implementing testable class:**
```
"Just finished ReviewService implementation"
‚Üí backend-code-reviewer automatically invoked

OR

"/finish-session review service complete"
‚Üí Runs tests, then suggests code review
```
