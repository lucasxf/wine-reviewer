## 🎯 Quick Start

### How Slash Commands Work

1. **Type the command** - Start with `/` in Claude Code CLI
2. **Auto-expansion** - Command expands to full prompt with context
3. **Execution** - Claude Code processes the expanded prompt
4. **Result** - Get structured output based on command purpose

### First Time Setup

Commands are already configured in `.claude/commands/`. No additional setup needed!

```bash
# Verify commands are available
ls .claude/commands/

# Should see:
# - start-session.md
# - finish-session.md
# - update-roadmap.md
# - directive.md
# - review-code.md
# - quick-test.md
# - test-quick.md
# - test-service.md
# - build-quiet.md
# - verify-quiet.md
# - docker-start.md
# - docker-stop.md
# - api-doc.md
```

3. Reviews recent git commits
4. Checks current git status
5. Summarizes current project state
6. Identifies next priority tasks

**Example usage:**
```bash
# Basic session start
/start-session

# With specific context
/start-session working on authentication flow

# With goal focus
/start-session implementing review submission
```

**What you get:**
- Current project status summary

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Always Start with `/start-session`

**✅ Good workflow:**
```bash
# Open Claude Code
/start-session implementing authentication

# Work on feature...

/finish-session authentication complete
```

**❌ Poor workflow:**
```bash
# Open Claude Code
"Help me implement authentication"
# (Missing context, wastes tokens)
```

---

### 2. Use `/finish-session` Before Committing

**✅ Good workflow:**
```bash
# Feature complete
/finish-session review service implemented

# Runs tests
# Updates docs
# Creates commit
```

**❌ Poor workflow:**
```bash
# Feature complete
git add .
git commit -m "stuff"
# (No tests run, docs not updated)
```

---

### 3. Test Incrementally with `/quick-test`

**✅ Good workflow:**
```bash
# Implement ReviewService
/quick-test ReviewService

# Implement ReviewController
/quick-test ReviewController

# Full verification
/verify-quiet
```

**❌ Poor workflow:**
```bash
# Implement everything
./mvnw test
# (Slow, verbose, wastes tokens)
```

---

### 4. Update Roadmap Regularly

**✅ Good workflow:**
```bash
# After each significant feature
/update-roadmap completed authentication with 18 tests

# During finish-session (automatic prompt)
/finish-session
```

**❌ Poor workflow:**
```bash
# Work for weeks
# Roadmap becomes stale
# Lost track of progress
```

---

### 5. Use Quiet Mode Commands for Efficiency

**✅ Token-efficient:**
```bash
/build-quiet
/verify-quiet
/test-quick
```

**❌ Token-wasteful:**
```bash
./mvnw clean install
./mvnw verify
./mvnw test
# (Verbose output wastes tokens)
```

---

## 🎨 Command Design Principles

All commands follow these principles:

1. **Context-Aware** - Load necessary project files
2. **Token-Efficient** - Minimize output, use quiet modes
3. **Verifiable** - Produce clear success/failure results
4. **Documented** - Clear purpose and usage
5. **Composable** - Can be chained in workflows
6. **Consistent** - Follow naming conventions
7. **Safe** - No destructive operations without confirmation

## 📐 Command vs Agent

**When to use commands:**
- Structured, repeatable workflows
- Token-efficient operations
- Quick context loading
- Standard development tasks

**When to use agents:**
- Complex reasoning needed
- Design decisions
- Learning and teaching
- Code review with analysis

**Both together:**
```bash
# Start with command for context
/start-session implementing review feature

# Use agent for design
"Design the review submission screen" → frontend-ux-specialist

# Use command for testing
/quick-test ReviewService

# Use agent for review
"Review my ReviewService implementation" → backend-code-reviewer

# Finish with command
/finish-session review feature complete
```

## 💭 Philosophy

**Commands embody the principle:**
> "Automate the routine, so you can focus on the creative."

They handle:
- ✅ Context loading
- ✅ Repetitive tasks
- ✅ Token optimization
- ✅ Standard workflows

So you can focus on:
- 🎨 Design
- 💡 Problem-solving
- 🚀 Innovation
- 📚 Learning

## 📊 Recent Updates (2025-11-11)

### `/create-pr` Enhanced with Two-Step Workflow

The `/create-pr` command now uses an optimized two-step process for automation analysis:

**Previous Behavior:**
- Single `automation-sentinel` invocation
- Full git history scan (expensive, slow)
- ~15,000 tokens per run

**New Behavior:**
1. **Step 1:** `pulse` agent (Haiku) - Collects metrics in delta mode
   - Updates `.claude/metrics/usage-stats.toml`
   - ~500-1000 tokens (Haiku is 10x cheaper)
2. **Step 2:** `automation-sentinel` (Sonnet) - Analyzes pre-collected metrics
   - Reads TOML file (no git scanning)
   - ~3000-5000 tokens

**Benefits:**
- ✅ 75% token reduction (3800 tokens vs 15,000 tokens)
- ✅ Faster execution (delta mode vs full history)
- ✅ Git-aware checkpoints (uses commit SHA)
- ✅ Consolidated lifetime metrics (not just incremental)

**Impact on Usage:**
- No changes needed to how you invoke `/create-pr`
- Workflow happens automatically
- Metrics stored in `.claude/metrics/usage-stats.toml` (git-tracked)

**Happy coding! 🚀**
